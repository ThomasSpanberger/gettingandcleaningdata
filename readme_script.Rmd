to use this file, source the run_analysis file, then simply type runanalysis() in your console

the run_analysis script is used to calculate the means of a data set collected on 30 subjects performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone

The dataset, and further information regarding the data, can be found at: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/

This script merges the data found in the dataset, and calculates the mean for every subject in this study for 6 different kinds of activities

The data set has to be extracted to the working directory, as defined in R, for this script to work
there are two files acompanying this readme: -another readme discussing the study, and the file features_info, describing the variables

Kind regards
Thomas
